# Chakra ui and framer motion study repository

## This repository involves the use of react with typescript, chakra ui and framer motion.

**Note: I tried to combine tailwindcss and chakra ui, but to be honest I don't see the point. Chakra ui is self-sufficient and if you are using tailwind, it alone is enough as well.**

_I think I will stick with tailwindcss lool, I don't know, I really like tailwind, but I want to get comfortable with chakra ui's docs, so in the future, if i want to use chakra ui, it would be easy to find my way around to want I want._
