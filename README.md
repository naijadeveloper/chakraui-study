# Chakra ui and framer motion study repository

## This repository involves the use of react with typescript, chakra ui and framer motion.

**Note: I tried to combine tailwindcss and chakra ui, but to be honest I don't see the point. Chakra ui is self-sufficient and if you are using tailwind, it alone is enough as well.**

_I like it, but I prefer tailwindcss lool._
